To complile, you will need the Python include files, the libpcap include files
and library, as well as the tool SWIG (see http://www.swig.org for more
information).

To run the sample program 'sniff.py', specify the interface name and 
filter expression on the command line like so:

[root@linuxbox pylibpcap]# ./sniff.py eth0 tcp port 80 

The documentation is a bit lacking at this point, but the sameple program
and libpcap man page should get you going.
