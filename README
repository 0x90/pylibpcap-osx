pylibpcap-0.6, 2007-02-14

To install run:
    python ./setup.py install

For Ubuntu/Debian systems you will probably need to install
the libpcap development package:
   apt-get install libpcap-dev

Had to manually add SWIG_PY_INT to mk-constants.py to support
swig-1.3.31

Normalized indentation to Python semi-standard 4 spaces.

Changed #!/usr/bin/env lines from python2 to python, since
no distros use python2 anymore.

pylibpcap-0.5, released 7/3/2005

This release contains the patches that have been accumulating in CVS,
and supports some features of newer libpcaps. It should build for
libpcap bersions >= 0.8.3. It can be built for earlier versions by
uncommenting lines in setup.py according to which features your version
of libpcap supports.  [wiml]

Apr 25, 2004 [wiml]:

There is a bug in libpcap and/or OpenBSD3.4 which results in a SEGV
if you call findalldevs() and you have a gif tunnel configured.
(See libpcap bug #941924 for details:
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?
      func=detail&aid=941924&group_id=53067&atid=469577 )

pylibpcap-0.4, released 6/14/02

Thanks to the following people who supplied patches:

- PC Drew for a fix to exception handling in callbacks.
- Gustavo Carneiro for various fixes to pcap_next() and to handling of
  packet capture lengths. 
- Jon Nelson for distutil patch.
- T. Meyarivan for finding and fixing memory leaks


To compile, you will need the Python include files, libpcap 0.7.1 includes
and library, as well as SWIG 1.3.12 if you wish to modify the interface 
(see http://www.swig.org for more information).  If you do wish to 
modify the interface, you'll need to change 'pcap.c' to 'pcap.i' in the
ext_modules section of the setup.py script.  Most users won't need to 
touch this however.

To build, simply run "python ./setup.py build", or "python2 ./setup.py build"

To run the sample program 'sniff.py', specify the interface name and 
filter expression on the command line like so:

[root@linuxbox pylibpcap]# ./sniff.py eth0 tcp port 80 

Please refer to the online module documentation (__doc__ attributes), and 
the pcap man page further information
